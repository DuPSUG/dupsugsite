# DuPSUG – Happy Holidays 2025 🎉 on YouTube📽️

Our second virtual session of the Dutch PowerShell User Group was a great success. Both Harm & Jeff delivered two great presentations, showcasing how PowerShell can be used to build creative integrations with AI tools. The audience was highly engaged, with great questions and live interaction throughout the session.

We’re excited to see such strong participation as we bring DuPSUG back online and continue building our community around automation and PowerShell. If you missed it, the full recordings are both now available on YouTube.
