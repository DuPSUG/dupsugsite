# DuPSUG – Winter 2026 ❄️

We’re getting together in person again on **February 4th, 2026**, and I’m genuinely excited about this one. It’s an evening focused on practical PowerShell, real-world security concerns, and sharing things that actually work.

We’ll start with dinner, dive into a focused security talk on keeping secrets away from AI assistants, and end with a community-driven show-and-tell where you can demo something you’re proud of—no pressure, no recordings, just the community sharing with the community!
