# DuPSUG – Autumn 2025 🍂

After a period of quiet, we are thrilled to restart the Dutch PowerShell User Group with a brand-new in-person edition. This marks the return of our community events, once again bringing people together around DevOps, PowerShell scripting, and automation in the Netherlands. Hosted at Rubicon HQ in Leusden, the evening will be a chance not only to learn but also to reconnect with fellow community members. Registration through Eventbrite is optional, with the benefit that you’ll receive an email notification, a calendar invite, and event updates.

## Speakers

As part of this restart, we have opened a Call for Papers to give both new and experienced speakers the opportunity to contribute. The full program will be announced soon.
