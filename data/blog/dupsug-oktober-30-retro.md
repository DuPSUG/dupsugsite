# DuPSUG – Autumn 2025 🍂 - Retrospective

Our first in-person DuPSUG event since the relaunch was a great success. A big thank you to our speakers, Rex de Koning and Leo Visser, for their engaging and insightful sessions. Rex explored the challenges and possibilities of securing Azure Functions, while Leo shared valuable insights on making automation more sustainable, both talks sparked great discussions and community interaction.

We’d also like to extend a special thanks to Rubicon for hosting us and supporting the PowerShell community. It was great to see both familiar and new faces joining us again. We look forward to seeing everyone at our upcoming sessions, join our Meetup to stay updated and check out the event photos there.

Join us on Meetup, and view the photos there!
