# Virtual DuPSUG ‚Äì Bring Your Own Tools on YouTubeüìΩÔ∏è

Our first virtual session of the Dutch PowerShell User Group was a great success. Doug Finke delivered an excellent presentation, Bring Your Own Tools: Extend AI with PowerShell Functions, showcasing how PowerShell can be used to build creative integrations with AI tools. The audience was highly engaged, with great questions and live interaction throughout the session.

We‚Äôre excited to see such strong participation as we bring DuPSUG back online and continue building our community around automation and PowerShell. If you missed it, the full recording is now available on YouTube.
